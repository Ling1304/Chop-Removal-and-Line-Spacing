# Chop-Removal-and-Line-Spacing
This repository contians a python code that uses OpenCV and other libraries to 
- deskew the scanned document
- remove any chops in scanned documents
- upscales the scanned document
- detect each individual sentence using contour detection
- allow users to select the amount of line spacing inserted between sentences.

This code was developed to enhance the readability of scanned physical receipts, which can be hard to read due to tight sentence spacing.
